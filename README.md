# Risk Dashboard development coordination
This repo coordinates and documents Health, DECAT, and consulting firms support to COVID fact track response projects. It consolidates and aligns contributions from a number of internal and external contributors.

## The ultimate objective is:
to assist WB teams in allocating resources sub-nationally and help them supervise their COVID projects. The derivative data outputs must be useful, honest, transparent, modular, repeatable and open to contributions from others. Wherever possible, derivative outputs should conform to WB policies on privacy and ethics, while at the same time able to be presented to government counterparts under appropriate circumstances.   

##### Priorities country outputs are:
Write to @KPGeo or @bpstewar for access to the resources below. The complete list of completed countries is [here]().

*beta versions of all data for each country are available [here - read only](https://worldbankgroup-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/kgarrett_worldbank_org/Emezutcmw_xLgUGBUml_RCwB9JDtdKrL1kz0LyXt1DRFbg?e=H7zaBX)*

## The Goal is:
 to assess and monitor the spatial and temporal distribution of risk factors of a COVID-19 outbreak to a given country along biological, behavioral and environmental lines. Input data are both descriptive and dynamic. Therefore, our chosen strategy is to come up with a consistent derivative data product (or map layer) that can serve as a lens to assess both static and dynamic factors and then to automate the process of generation and share this layer to all WB teams and partners who can use it as a common standard for input into resource allocation decisions.

## Key Questions:
  1. Where is risk to the population concentrated? (Due to age, co-morbidity, density, amenity availability )
  2. How much capacity does the local health system have to respond?
  3. What Non Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) have been tried - Where and When?
  4. How has mobility varied across space and time?
  5. What effect has changes in mobility had on local risk of transmission?
  6. What is the local trend in cases?
  7. What interventions have been done?
